## Using
### 1. Install Anaconda 
Anaconda is the preferred method of installing DeepFaceLab on Linux.
[Just follow the tutorial](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install).  

### 2. Install System Dependencies 
You will need FFMpeg, Git, and the most recent NVIDIA driver for your system to use this project.

If you are here, then you already have everything...

### 3. Install DeepFaceLab

Just run it in the terminal.

Check latest cudnn and cudatoolkit version for your GPU device.

```bash
 conda create -n deepfacelab -c main python=3.7 cudnn=7.6.5 cudatoolkit=10.1.243
 conda activate deepfacelab
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nagadit/DeepFaceLab_Linux.git
 cd DeepFaceLab_Linux
 git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/iperov/DeepFaceLab.git
 python -m pip install -r ./DeepFaceLab/requirements-cuda.txt
```
必须 opencv-python-headless==4.5.1.48

you can confirm your gpu is working correctly by running the following code and seeing what messages pop up:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf;print(tf.__version__)"
```

If the scripts can't seem to access the GPU and you're having issues with cuda version mismatches when running `nvidia-smi`, they can sometimes be remedied by simply running

```bash
conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1
```

## 4. Download Pretrain (optional)
Use script 4.1 from the scripts directory.
 
Or download manually
